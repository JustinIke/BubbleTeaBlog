**Taste**\
The mango puree oolong tea is refreshing because it is not too sweet. I was not smacked with a bunch of sugar. It is granular; I felt the puree in my mouth. At first sip, it gives a light mango flavour with a strong tea taste afterwards. It was very flavourful and not watery.

The pearls were quite small and a bit soggy, but still chewy. The tiny apple slices on the top were a nice touch. It added to the freshness aspect I got when assessing the sugar level.

Side note: I had a few sips of the strawberry puree assam black tea. It was alright. It  first gives off a tea flavour and ends with a strawberry aftertaste.

**Look**\
The cups were good quality as the plastic was hard and no flimsy. I feel the cup could be reused if you wanted to keep it and wash it. The lids had cute little heart caps on them. Even though the straws were made out of plants, they were still strong. They do not disintegrate like how paper straws do when they are left in a liquid for a prolonged time.

**Atmosphere**\
The restaurant is a cute little place. They do not have much seating, so I would make a reservation the next time or not come during prime time. We sat at the bar which I don't mind. There was a secret built-in hook under the counter for us to hang our coats. I found it very handy as we did not have backs to our stools. The server made the bubble tea right in front of us. It was cool to see the process. She used a cocktail shaker to mix the drinks.

They Rocky Mountain Soap in their bathroom - definitely get brownie points from me for the fancy soap. The bathroom was not the most aesthetic thing as they had extra chairs and furniture stored in there.

The plate-setting for my ramen was a cute board made out of recycled chopsticks. A bunch of their stuff was made out of recycled chopsticks. They had a sign made out of chopsticks saying they recycled 9967 chopsticks in 2021 with ChopValue YYC. When I went home, I googled this company and am now planning on buying a cheese board for someone's birthday.

**Final Words**\
The pearls were not the greatest, but I would possibly give it another try. They might've been having an off day with their pearls.
