Hi. I'm Angelina and this is my bubble tea blog. Here, I will be reviewing bubble tea drinks that I buy and writing about my adventures with the wonderful beverage. I hope it inspires you to try new bubble tea drinks.

**So why bubble tea?**\
It is my go-to drink. I once bought a bag of pearls bigger than my head so I could make it at home everyday and not spend so much $$. Whenever I travel, I always try to find local boba shops to try out.\

BUT with the simplest words: I love bubble tea.

**So why am I here?**\
My partner is a software developer and offered to help make me a website. To be candid, life is stressful and I want a care-free creative outlet. I think it can be a small way to fulfill that desire. After graduating high school, I jumped into a biology degree without knowing what I wanted to do with it. After completing that degree, I hopped between a few jobs until I found the one I am currently at. I love where I work, but I am still searching for what I am truly passionate about. This site is something new that will hopefully direct me to my calling - or maybe it is a tiny step out of the thousand I may make to finally opening my own boba shop that I have always dreamt about - or might just feed into my bubble tea addiction.

If you would like to help fund my new hobby of reviewing bubble tea, you can e-transfer me. I AM JUST KIDDING, don't do that :P
