Hi. I'm Angelina and this is my bubble tea blog. Here, I will be reviewing bubble tea drinks that I buy and writing about my adventures with the wonderful beverage.

**So why bubble tea?**\
It is my go-to drink when just out and about or when I am at home and can convince my partner to go get some with me. Whenever I travel, I always try to find local boba shops to try out.\
BUT with the simplest words: I love bubble tea (I once bought a bag of pearls as bigger than my head so I could make it at home everyday and not spend so much $$).

**So why am I here?**\
To be candid, life is stressful and I want a care-free creative outlet. I think this site can be a small way to fulfill that desire. After graduating high school, I jumped into a biology degree without knowing what I wanted to do with it, After completing that degree, I jumped into a few jobs until I found the one I am currently working at. I love where I work, but I am still searching for what I am truly passionate about. This is something new that will hopefully direct me to my calling - or maybe it is a tiny step out of the thousand I may make to finally opening my own boba shop that I keep talking about.
