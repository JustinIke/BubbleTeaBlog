**Taste**\
Fresh fruit was used (I saw him use a real cantaloupe, not frozen or powder). Basically, the drink tasted like what a cantaloupe tastes like with tiny hints of tea. Sips without crushed ice gave more of a tea flavour. It wasn't too sugary. This is a type of drink I would get again on a hot summer day, because the fresh fruit and ice are refreshing; it isn't sour like lemonade. Kind of reminded me of the cantaloupe juice my mom used to make for me as a kid.

The pearls were not fresh and not plentiful. They were still chewy and not doughy. This order comes with the pearls. Extra toppings are $0.75. If I were to get this again, I would want more pearls, but don't know if I want to pay for extra them...

The presentation was cute because of the thin slices of fruit on the top (looked better before he put on the lid). It is interesting how they put the pearls on the top  of the drink. I have never seen this before. My drink did not look like their advertisement.

The stand had Christmas and Easter decor. The sign with their name/logo is clean and slick. I love the play-on words. The lettering on the menu is neat and readable.  I like the use of acid-free paper. It is awkward that you can see everything in the shop; they could be a bit more tidy.

There was only one worker so I had to wait for him to take my order after he was done making bubble tea for the customers before me. I felt sort of bad because if I were in his place, it would be stressful to be myself.

**Final Words**\
I started a stamp card. Let's see if I use it again!
