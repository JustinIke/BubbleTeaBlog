**Taste**\
Fresh fruit was used (I saw him use a real cantaloupe, not frozen or powder). Basically, the drink tasted like what a cantaloupe tastes like with tiny hints of tea. Sips without crushed ice gave more of a tea flavour. It wasn't too sugary. This is a type of drink I would get again on a hot summer day, because of the refreshing aspect of the fresh fruit and ice. Also, it wasn't sour like lemonade. Kind of reminded me of the cantaloupe juice my mom used to make for me as a kid.

The pearls were not fresh and not plentiful. They were still chewy and not doughy. This order comes with the pearls. Extra toppings are $0.75. If I were to get this again, I would want more pearls, but don't know if I want to pay for extra them... The drink is already pricy for the size compared to other shops.

**Look**\
The presentation was cute because of the thin slices of fruit on the top (looked better before he put on the lid). It was interesting how they put the pearls on the top  of the drink. I had never seen this before. 

My drink did not look like their advertisement. The crushed ice floated on top of the cup and took about 1/3 of its space. You could see the separation between the ice and liquid. The appearance of the crushed ice was not super appealing.

**Atmosphere**\
The stand had Christmas and Easter decoration; I don't know what holiday they were trying to celebrate. It was awkward that I could see everything in the shop; they could be a bit more tidy. The sign with their name/logo was clever and clean. I love the play-on words. The lettering on the menu was neat and readable, but they spelled pineapple wrong. The crafty side of me loved the use of acid-free paper.

There was only one worker so I had to wait for him to take my order after he was done making bubble tea for the customers before me. I felt sort of bad because if I were in his place, it would be stressful to be myself. My partner sat and ate tacos at a table near their booth. There was a point where the worker left and potential customers ended up leaving after a few minutes of waiting at the till.

**Final Words**\
Not bad for a local shop #shoplocal. I started a stamp card. Let's see if I remember to use it again!
