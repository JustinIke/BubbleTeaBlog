**Taste**\
Bubblemania Cafe was a go-to spot for my friends or cousins and I (started in junior high). As a kid, I thought this was the best bubble tea. Granted I haven't experienced anywhere else at the time. It is not as good as I remember. I still go this restaurant but not as often as I used to. Before this Sunday, I haven't been since March 5, 2020.

Their classic powder taro milk tea was a moderately watery and milky. The tapioca pearls were slimy and sticky; I could feel their residue on my teeth. They were soggy on the outside and hard in the center (not fresh). The pearls were not sweet and didn't taste like much. It was like I was just chewing on rubber.

Side note: I got the drink Eternal Love with tapioca pearls to-go for my partner. It is mango and lychee fruit syrup blended with ice. I've had this before and enjoyed it. It is pretty sugary though.

**Look**\
I appreciate the effort to colour coordinate the straws to the colour of the drink. They used to give us our pearls separate from our drink, in a small dish. This did not happen. I liked feature because I could portion my pearls and make sure I had some throughout the entire meal.

**Atmosphere**\
The people working their are always attractive Asians. They were wearing masks so it was hard to see if they were my best friend's type. Our server was nice and friendly as I embarrassed myself by outwardly commenting on how I was full. I accidentally kicked him as I was getting out of the booth to let my friend in.

The server asked gave us a choice to use online ordering or order through him. We went for the in-person experience. The food and drinks came out really fast. Their plates have their logos on them now. However, they are smaller resulting in a smaller portion size in the house special fried rice that we shared.

**Final Words**\
I didn't finish my drink which is rare. I am not going to boycott bubbles, because it might've been the milk and my body was just having a lactose-intolerant day.
