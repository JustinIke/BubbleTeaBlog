**Customs:** 100% sugar, No ice

**Taste**\
This drink is a regular order for me. It is my go-to for when I do not want something fruity or to try anything new. It always tastes the similar every time - like a classic milk tea. 

The pearls were chewy, but a bit hard in the center when you bite down on them. I personally like me pearls fresh and chewy, so these ones were fine to me.

It was free and free drinks taste better than drinks I have to pay for. Got to love Chatime rewards!

**Atmosphere**\
The store was clean with most of the chairs were up on the tables, which isn't the most visually appealing. However, we are in a COVID world that does not allow much indoor dining. Hopefully this pandemic is over soon and we can sit and chat and enjoy boba with our friends.

Music was good. The worker was singing under her breath while I was deciding what to order. I was also quietly jamming as I waiting for my drink.

**Final Words**\
Overall, it was decent and would get this combination again!
